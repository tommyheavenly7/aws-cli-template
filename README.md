# project-template

A template provides essential stuff for vue.js projects.

## Quick Start

First, you need to prepare `.bashrc` to set the environment variables and command aliases. Please create and edit it before running docker commands.

```shell
mv docker/.bashrc.dist docker/.bashrc
```

After loading `.bashrc`, you can run shortcut commands for setting up the project.

```shell
source docker/.bashrc
_build
_up
```
