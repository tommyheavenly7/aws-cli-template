# project-template

A template provides essential stuff.

## Quick Start

First, you might want to prepare `.bashrc` to set the environment variables and command aliases. Please create and edit it before running docker commands.

```shell
mv .bashrc.dist .bashrc
```

```shell
source .bashrc
docker-compose up --no-start --force-recreate
```
